## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

We follow modern ES6+ JavaScript conventions:

#### Variables and Constants

```javascript
// Use const by default, let when reassignment is needed
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 1000;
let currentPreview = null;

// Use descriptive names
const isValidPreviewUrl = (url) => { /* ... */ };

// Avoid var
```

#### Functions

```javascript
// Use async/await for asynchronous code
async function fetchContent(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Arrow functions for callbacks
element.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  handleClick(e);
});
```

#### Error Handling

```javascript
// Always handle errors gracefully
try {
  await riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  showUserFriendlyError();
}
```

#### Comments

```javascript
// Use comments to explain "why", not "what"
// Good:
// Delay to prevent preview flicker on quick mouse movements
setTimeout(() => showPreview(), 100);

// Bad:
// Wait 100ms then show preview
setTimeout(() => showPreview(), 100);
```

#### Code Organization

```javascript
// Group related functionality in classes
class LinkPreview {
  constructor() {
    this.init();
  }

  async init() {
    await this.loadSettings();
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  // Use descriptive method names
  handleMouseOver(event) { /* ... */ }
  createPreviewWindow(content) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### HTML/CSS Standards

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep inline styles minimal (use them only for dynamic values)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add ARIA labels for accessibility

### Manifest.json

- Keep permissions minimal
- Document any new permissions in comments
- Follow Manifest V3 standards

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Good:
- "Fix preview window positioning on small screens"
- "Add support for custom keyboard shortcuts"
- "Refactor settings storage logic"

Bad:
- "fix bug"
- "update"
- "changes"
```

**Commit Message Format:**

```
<type>: <subject>

<body (optional)>

<footer (optional)>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**

```
feat: Add keyboard shortcut customization

Users can now configure custom keyboard shortcuts for triggering
link previews in the extension settings.

Closes #42
